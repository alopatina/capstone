# 1. clean zoning data data from ZAP

filtered from the ZAP website

```{r}

knitr::include_graphics("/Users/aslop/Documents/CLASSES/FALL 2019/Capstone class/data/data 2/Capture.jpg")

```



```{r}
appl <- read_csv("/Users/aslop/Documents/CLASSES/FALL 2019/Capstone class/data/data 2/Zoning Application Portal data.csv")
```

```{r}
appl %>%
  count(applicants, sort = TRUE)
```

to filter I am assuming that accronyms stand for punblic angencies, while everything else is private applications
we filter out non-ULURP as ULURP is required only when you need to make a zoning change https://www.brownstoner.com/development/ulurp/


```{r}
public <- appl %>% 
  filter(applicants %in% c("HPD", "LPC", "DCAS", "DCP", "DEP", "ACS/CAS", "DPR", "DEP/CAS", "DOT", "DOS/CAS", "DBS", "CAS/EDC", "CFD/CAS", "DSBS", "EDC", "DBS/EDC", "CAS/DEP", "EDC/CAS", "HPD/EDC", "NYP/CAS", "BPC", "CAS/ACS", "DOP/CAS", "DSB", "SBP (S.I.

```

TO DO: need to ask ZAP about shapefiles

```{r}
nyzma <- read_sf("C:/Users/aslop/Documents/CLASSES/FALL 2019/Capstone class/data/rezonings from Alexia/nyzma/geo_export_0f3bcbeb-a5f6-4103-83fe-794dad40af53.shp") 

# nyzma matadata: https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/planning/download/pdf/data-maps/open-data/nyzma_metadata.pdf?r=1219
```

```{r}
pub_geo <- public %>% 
  left_join(nyzma, by = c("dcp-projectname" = "project_na")) %>% 
  select(`dcp-projectbrief`, `geometry`, everything()) %>% 
  mutate(geometry_1 = as.character(geometry)) %>% 
  filter(geometry_1 !='list()') %>% 
  select(-geometry_1)
```


```{r}
class(pub_geo)

# convert to sf format
pub_geo_sf <- st_sf(pub_geo, crs = 2263)

st_crs(pub_geo_sf)

# this file contains all publicly-initiated rezonings 2000-2007
```


# 2. clean demographic data from US Census and ACS -- demographic trends between 1990 to 2018

we standardize all census boundaries to the boundaries of the last census in 2010

```{r}
# add key for censusapi
Sys.setenv(CENSUS_KEY = "2ce05dbf2fa6fb1131a28747d83bf6b622709f54")
```


We extract data from 3 surveys: 1990, 2000 and 2010
First we extract names of the variables
```{r}
sf1_2010_meta <- listCensusMetadata("dec/sf1", 2010)
sf1_2000_meta <- listCensusMetadata("sf3", 2000)
sf1_1990_meta <- listCensusMetadata("sf3", 1990)
```

```{r}
# get NYC
# NYC code 36
# Bronx County 005
# New York County 061
# Kings County 047
# Queens County 081
# Richmond County 085

# total housing units H001001

# get housing units in NYC for 2010 census
sf1_2010_cen <- getCensus(name = "dec/sf1", vintage = 2010, vars = c(house = "H001001"), region = "tract:*",
                          regionin = "state:36+county:061,005,047,081,085")
```

```{r}
# get housing units in NYC for 2000 census
sf3_2000_cen <- getCensus(name = "sf3", vintage = 2000, vars = c(house = "H001001"), region = "tract:*",
                          regionin = "state:36+county:061,005,047,081,085")
```

```{r}
sf3_1990_cen <- getCensus(name = "sf3", vintage = 1990, vars = c(house = "H0010001"), region = "tract:*",
                          regionin = "state:36+county:061,005,047,081,085")
```


download crosswalk from here https://s4.ad.brown.edu/projects/diversity/Researcher/LTBDDload/DataList.aspx

The 2000-2010 crosswalk identifies what kind of boundary change occurred for each tract (the column heading is "changetype"). 1 = no change. 2 = multiple tracts merged to one. 3 = one tract split into more than one. 4 = 2+ tracts reconfigured into different 2+ tracts.

```{r}
crosswalk_00 <- read_csv("C:/Users/aslop/Documents/CLASSES/FALL 2019/Capstone class/data/data 2/crosswalk_2000_2010.csv")


crosswalk_90 <- read_csv("C:/Users/aslop/Documents/CLASSES/FALL 2019/Capstone class/data/data 2/crosswalk_1990_2010.csv")
```

```{r}
# Filter observations in MN
mn <- paste0("^36", "061", collapse = "|")
# Queens
qn <- paste0("^36", "081", collapse = "|")
# brooklyn
bn <- paste0("^36", "047", collapse = "|")
# bronx
bx <- paste0("^36", "005", collapse = "|")
# staten island
st <- paste0("^36", "085", collapse = "|")

codes_all <- c("^36047", "^36005", "^36061", "^36081", "^36085")


```

```{r}
crosswalk_mn <- crosswalk_00 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(trtid00, mn))

crosswalk_qn <- crosswalk_00 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(trtid00, qn))

crosswalk_bn <- crosswalk_00 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(trtid00, bn))

crosswalk_bx <- crosswalk_00 %>%

crosswalk_st <- crosswalk_00 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(trtid00, st))

crosswalk_all <- bind_rows(crosswalk_mn, crosswalk_qn, crosswalk_bn, crosswalk_bx, crosswalk_st)

The next step is to interpolate the data for the year 2000 to adjust to the 2010 census tracts. The code below does the interpolation. It takes the 2000 census data frame and adds a variable “trtid00” by pasting together the state, county, and tract variables. With this new variable, it is joined with the crosswalk data. The weighting variable from the crosswalk data is used to calculate the interpolated total number of housing units. With the weight applied, the adjustments are added together for the 2010 tracts.


```{r}
interpolated_2000 <- sf3_2000_cen %>% 
  mutate(trtid00 = paste0(state, county, tract)) %>% 
  full_join(crosswalk_all, by = "trtid00") %>% 
  mutate(weight = as.numeric(weight)) %>% 
  mutate(H001001_2000 = round(H001001 * weight))%>% 
  select(trtid10, H001001_2000) %>% 
  group_by(trtid10) %>% 
  summarise_all(sum)%>% 
#  filter(str_detect(trtid10, codes_all)) %>% 
  mutate(state = str_sub(trtid10, 1, 2),
         county = str_sub(trtid10, 3, 5),
         tract = str_sub(trtid10, 6, 11),) %>% 
  select(state, county, tract, H001001_2000)  
```

2000 housing unit data is now ready to be joined with our 2010 data. Using dplyr makes this easy to do and intuitive to read. Note that extra steps would be needed if you are working with dollar values, such as median home income. When working with dollar values, you’ll also need to adjust for inflation.
As shown below, we join the data by their matching identifiers, and then we calculate an additional variable to determine the growth rate from 2000 to 2010.

```{r}
h_units_2000_2010 <- interpolated_2000 %>% 
  full_join(sf1_2010_cen, by = c("state", "county", "tract")) %>% 
  rename(H001001_2010 = H001001) %>% 
  mutate(growth_rate = round(((H001001_2010 - H001001_2000) / H001001_2000) * 100, digits = 2)) %>% 
  unite("id", c(state, county, tract), sep = "")
```


 crosswalk with 1990

```{r}
crosswalk_mn_90 <- crosswalk_90 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(trtid90, mn))

crosswalk_qn_90 <- crosswalk_90 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(trtid90, qn))

crosswalk_bn_90 <- crosswalk_90 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(trtid90, bn))

crosswalk_bx_90 <- crosswalk_90 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(trtid90, bx))

crosswalk_st_90 <- crosswalk_90 %>% 
  filter(str_detect(trtid90, st))

crosswalk_all_90 <- bind_rows(crosswalk_mn_90, crosswalk_qn_90, crosswalk_bn_90, crosswalk_bx_90, crosswalk_st_90)
```

```{r}
interpolated_1990 <- sf3_1990_cen %>% 
  mutate(trtid90 = paste0(state, county, tract)) %>% 
  full_join(crosswalk_all_90, by = "trtid90") %>% 
  mutate(weight = as.numeric(weight)) %>% 
  mutate(H001001_1990 = round(H0010001 * weight))%>% 
  select(trtid10, H001001_1990) %>% 
  group_by(trtid10) %>% 
  summarise_all(sum) %>% 
#  filter(str_detect(trtid10, codes_all)) %>% 
  mutate(state = str_sub(trtid10, 1, 2),
         county = str_sub(trtid10, 3, 5),
         tract = str_sub(trtid10, 6, 11)) %>% 
  select(state, county, tract, H001001_1990)  
```

```{r}
h_units_1990_2010 <- interpolated_1990 %>% 
  full_join(sf1_2010_cen, by = c("state", "county", "tract")) %>% 
  rename(H001001_2010 = H001001) %>% 
  mutate(growth_rate = round(((H001001_2010 - H001001_1990) / H001001_1990) * 100, digits = 2)) %>% 
  unite("id", c(state, county, tract), sep = "")
```

```{r}
h_units900010 <- h_units_1990_2010 %>% 
  full_join(h_units_2000_2010, by = c("id" = "id")) %>% 
  select(-growth_rate.x, -growth_rate.y, - H001001_2010.x) %>% 
  filter(id != "NANANA")
```

# 3. Spatial join with the zoning file (pub_geo_sf)

geotract source: https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/2010-Census-Tracts/fxpq-c8ku

```{r}

# pad county with 00, add 36

geotract_1 <- geotract %>% 
#  mutate(county = str_pad(boro_code, width = 3, side = "left", pad = "0"),
#         state = "36") %>% 
  mutate(county = case_when(boro_name == "Manhattan" ~ "061",
                            boro_name == "Queens" ~ "081",

add geographic shapes to h_units900010

```{r}
h_units900010_geo <- h_units900010 %>% 
  left_join(geotract_1, by = c("id" = "id")) %>% 
  st_sf(crs = 2263)

st_crs(h_units900010_geo) 

class(pub_geo_sf)
```

add demographic data to the identified zonings by clipping with geoshapes

```{r}
intersect <- st_intersection(h_units900010_geo, pub_geo_sf)
```

```{r}
# view on the google map
leaflet(intersect) %>% 
  addPolygons() %>%
